# RESTfulChess
This is a full stack Chess application

The backend utilizes the Java Spring Boot framework to implement a REST API to handle and manage requests to instantiate new games and
commmunicate game data with via asynchronous requests handled through multithreading

The front end is implemented all through  HTML/CSS/Javascript and heavily utilizes the Fetch API to communicate with the server and use the data
within its event listeners.

All code written by me EXCEPT the code responsible for rendering the initial board. That is through the chessboardjs library
